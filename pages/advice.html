            <h2>Finding Events/Bars/Restaurants ✨</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Righteous Eats  – Great video recs for affordable spots with heart. Never steered us wrong. </li>
                <li>Eater NY – Solid reviews, openings, neighborhood guides.</li>
                <li>Time Out – Weekly roundup of bars, events, pop-ups.</li>
                <li>Seasonal Stuff:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Winter ❄️– Christmas markets @ Union + Bryant Park + Grand Central.</li>
                        <li>Summer ☀️– Food festivals, Smorgasburg in Greenpoint, Free Movie Nights @ Bryant Park.</li>

            <h2>Tourist Trap Hot Takes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Top of the Rock – Worth it once. Great views, you can actually see the Empire State.</li>
                <li>Statue of Liberty – Skip the island unless you’re going up top (book ahead). Ellis Island is cool for family research. Or admire it from the free Staten Island Ferry.</li>
                <li>Rockefeller Center – Lovely at Christmas. Tree + FAO Schwarz = ✨ Under Rockefeller is an extensive mall.</li>
                <li>Times Square – Chaos. Worth seeing once. Skip the dollar slices here (overpriced + bad). Better nearby: Rudy’s for cheap beer + free hot dog 🌭. Avoid the HIMYM bar. We like Margaritaville, Juniors (for cheesecake only), and the beer selection at Yard House. Obviously, the Broadway shows are worth it! </li>
                <li>Central Park – Visit the zoo, walk the dirt paths, and bring binoculars for birdwatching. Ask to borrow ours!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>🦺 Overall Safety</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stick to well-lit streets with lots of open shops and delis – more people = more peace of mind.</li>
                <li>Keep your wallet in your front pocket and use cross body purses in order to avoid pick-pockets!</li>
                <li>On the subway platform stand with your back against a wall or behind a column – at the very least away from the yellow line for safety. Don’t get bumped onto the tracks.</li>
                <li>Jaywalking 🚶is now legal ✨ but exercise that carefully! Look both ways when crossing the street even on one-way roads. Bikers speed down the wrong way a lot!</li>
                <li>Pay attention to your surroundings bc sometimes we got folks doing random punching/stabbing/shoving onto subways. Only a handful of instances in a city of 8 million but worth noting.</li>
                <li>If you get mugged (super unlikely), avoid eye contact and hand over your stuff. Things can be replaced — you can’t. Making eye contact/being able to identify them, makes them harming you more likely.</li>
                <li>And finally: if you’re standing still looking at your phone, step to the side to be courteous – This isn’t a safety issue aside from the fact that I will smack you 👊 if I see you doing this!</li>
