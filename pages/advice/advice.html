        <h2>🔥 Tourist Trap Hot Takes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Top of the Rock – Worth it once. Great views, you can actually see
            the Empire State.
          </li>
          <li>
            Statue of Liberty – Skip the island unless you’re going up top (book
            ahead). Ellis Island is cool for family research. Or admire it from
            the free Staten Island Ferry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rockefeller Center – Lovely at Christmas. Tree + FAO Schwarz = ✨
            Under Rockefeller is an extensive mall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Times Square – Chaos. Worth seeing once. Skip the dollar slices here
            (overpriced + bad). Better nearby: Rudy’s for cheap beer + free hot
            dog 🌭. Avoid the HIMYM bar. We like Margaritaville, Juniors (for
            cheesecake only), and the beer selection at Yard House. Obviously,
            the Broadway shows are worth it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Central Park – Visit the zoo, walk the dirt paths, and bring
            binoculars for birdwatching. Ask to borrow ours!
          </li>

        <h2>🦺 Overall Safety</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stick to well-lit streets with lots of open shops and delis – more
            people = more peace of mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your wallet in your front pocket and use cross body purses in
            order to avoid pick-pockets!
          </li>
          <li>
            On the subway platform stand with your back against a wall or behind
            a column – at the very least away from the yellow line for safety.
            Don’t get bumped onto the tracks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jaywalking 🚶is now legal ✨ but exercise that carefully! Look both
            ways when crossing the street even on one-way roads. Bikers speed
            down the wrong way a lot!
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay attention to your surroundings bc sometimes we got folks doing
            random punching/stabbing/shoving onto subways. Only a handful of
            instances in a city of 8 million but worth noting.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you get mugged (super unlikely), avoid eye contact and hand over
            your stuff. Things can be replaced — you can’t. Making eye
            contact/being able to identify them, makes them harming you more
            likely.
          </li>
          <li>
            And finally: if you’re standing still looking at your phone, step to
            the side to be courteous – This isn’t a safety issue aside from the
            fact that I will smack you 👊 if I see you doing this!
